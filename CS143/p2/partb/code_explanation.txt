Our code changes for part B were fairly simple. Mostly we just reused the Copycat code and made a couple of small
changes to fit the spec.

In the HTML file, we removed the simple textbox and added an HTML option menu. It was given the name "menu" so its
value could be referenced in the Java interface file, and loaded with 5 options, the first of which was the default
selection. We kept the same submit button as its functionality was universal between the two.

The Java file was then modified only slightly: the input to request.getParameter is now given as "menu" as that is the 
name of our HTML menu and we want to get the data from that. The rest of the file was basically unchanged as the output
HTML file is exactly the same formatting.
