Lab 7 Report

Since I was performing this lab on my own Ubuntu laptop and not the 
UCLA linux server, the first thing I had to do was download and install
sshd, as Ubuntu only comes with the client version by default. I did this
via

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Next I added a new 'guest' user. I found using the GUI to be a bit
cumbersome so I used the command line instead:

sudo useradd -d /home/GUEST -m 'GUEST'
sudo passwd GUEST

Next, we have to generate a key on another computer so the other user can
log into this machine:

ssh-keygen -t dsa

Then, we add the generated key to this machine by copying it over:

scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub GUEST@LOCAL_IP/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh copy-id GUEST@LOCAL_IP

We add it to our keys using the command
ssh-add

Now we have the public key from the other computer so it has the ability
to log in. To connect, it simply has to run the command

ssh -X GUEST@LOCAL_IP
(the -X is to enable X11 forwarding)

Because we typed -X in our login, the logged in computer should be able to
enter the command

xterm

and get a shell window.
