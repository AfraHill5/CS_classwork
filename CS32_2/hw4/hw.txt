2. A compliation error occurs because there is no way to compare 2 Points, which
   is required to perform many of the operations in the Map template class.
   The function will compile if you declare an operator!= in the Point class,
   so the template has a way to implement comparisons between 2 Points.

3b.It would be impossible to implement using the listAll function recursively
   because there is no way to pass the current path "down" the recursion
   as a string The current iteration would have no way of knowing the 
   labels of its parents in the tree.

4a.This is an O(N^3) algorithm. It executes 3 loops, each iterating from 0 to 
   N, nested within each other.  
 
 b.This is still an O(N^3) algorithm. It still runs 3 nested loops, each dependent
   directly on the size of N. Although this loop runs faster than the loop from
   part A, it still increases in time complexity on an N^3 scale.

5. The get() function is O(1) if called with an index number, and O(N) if called
   without one (since it needs to iterate through to search for the value.)
   So, the combine() function should be O(N^2) since it contains one loop iterating
   from 0 to N, which calls get() without an index once within it.
