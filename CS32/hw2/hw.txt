Homework 2

#2. The first 12 Coords popped off the stack using the supplied main() have (r,c) values:

(6,3)
(6,4)
(7,4)
(8,4)
(8,3)
(8,2)
(7,2)
(5,4)
(5,5)
(5,6)
(6,6)
(7,6)
 ...

#4. The first 12 coords dequeued using the supplied main() have (r,c) values:

(6,3)
(5,3)
(6,2)
(6,4)
(4,3)
(5,4)
(7,2)
(7,4)
(4,2)
(5,5)
(8,2)
(8,4)


These two algorithms differ in the way they "follow" possible paths. The stack function runs the most
recently added coordinates first; in this way it follows any possible paths outward, all the way to their end, only stopping
when they hit a wall or there is no further progress to be made. The queue function just slowly creeps outward from 
the starting point, adding a coordinate from each possible path one step at a time and then moving onto another
possible path. Both are absolutely viable and it picking one over the other simply depends on which way suits 
the surrounding implementation.
