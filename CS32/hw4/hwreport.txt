2.
The problem with the call to Bag<URL>::insert is that it initializes a URL object and 
tries to insert it at the same time. The URL needs to have a variable name associated
with it -- you can't just insert a blank URL object and initialize it at the same time.
To fix this, either put "new" in front of the object so it is initalized at runtime, or
put "URL u = new URL("http://www.symantec.com")" on the line before it, and 
"bu.insert(u)" instead of the last line.


3b.
In order to recursively output the different string pathnames of the various files, the 
program needs to have the ability to pass all the previous pathnames to the next directory.
When the function reaches party.jpg, it needs to have all the previous pathnames so it 
can output the exact location and not just the name of the file with no background. Thus,
as it goes "deeper" it can keep track of every directory "opened" so when it finally
reaches the "end" (a non-directory file) it can output all the previous directories as well.


4a.
This function is O(N^3); it contains 3 nested for loops that are each called N times.

b.
Still O(N^3), but faster than a. The second loop still increases in magnitude relative to N.


5a.
Time complexity is O(N). Specifically, it checks 2 items for every N number of items in the first
bag, so the time taken increases directly with N.

b.
Time complexity is still O(N), but this algorithm is slower than the one in a. A runs relative to
2N, while b is closer to 4N due to its 3 for loops, one for each Bag and one the size of both
Bags combined.
